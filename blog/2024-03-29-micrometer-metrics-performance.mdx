Vert.x 5 is coming with many great new features and enhancements.

In this article, you'll learn about the Vert.x Micrometer Metrics performance improvements.

## Introduction

A few users reported issues regarding the impact of enabling monitoring with Vert.x Micrometer Metrics.
In practice, they observed the problem by measuring the throughput of their application.
With monitoring enabled, the throughput decreased, sometimes to a significant degree.

Such problems can't be analyzed and adressed without:

- a good reproducer, and
- a proper benchmarking environment.

Fortunately, we have both.
The Vert.x team has been working for a long time on performance improvenents using the [TechEmpower Web Framework Benchmarks](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks).
