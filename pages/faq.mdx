### The `logActivity` option is enabled, but nothing is logged

Most Vert.x network clients or servers have a `logActivity` option which enables network activity logging.
When active, Netty's pipeline is configured for logging on Netty's logger, at `DEBUG` level

This is why switching on the `logActivity` option is not enough.
You also have to set the `io.netty.handler.logging.LoggingHandler` logger to `DEBUG` level in your logging framework configuration.

## When Vert.x is clustered, what happens to event-bus messages if a node crashes?

When you send a message on the event-bus, it is sent to the recipient's node and stored in memory until it is processed.
It is **not** persisted to disk or a database.

Consequently, if the recipient's node crashes before the message is processed, the message is lost.

If it's not possible to tolerate loss of some messages, there are a few options including:

- idempotent retry when sending fails with an error
- asynchronous acknowlegdement

Otherwise, consider using a full-fledged broker-based messaging system like [Apache ActiveMQ](http://activemq.apache.org/) or [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/).

Vert.x has clients for such solutions: [Vert.x AMQP Client](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-amqp-client/java/), [RabbitMQ Client for Vert.x](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-rabbitmq-client/java/) or [Vert.x-Stomp](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-stomp/java/).

## Why doesn't my event-bus consumer pickup messages sent previously?

When you publish a message on the event-bus, it is sent to all nodes having one or more consumers registered for the corresponding message address.
It is **not** persisted to disk or a database.

Consequently, new consumers on existing nodes or nodes joining the cluster later will **not** receive this message.

If you need this feature, consider using a full-fledged broker-based messaging system like [Apache ActiveMQ](http://activemq.apache.org/) or [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/).

Vert.x has clients for such solutions: [Vert.x AMQP Client](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-amqp-client/java/), [RabbitMQ Client for Vert.x](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-rabbitmq-client/java/) or [Vert.x-Stomp](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-stomp/java/).
