### The `logActivity` option is enabled, but nothing is logged

Most Vert.x network clients or servers have a `logActivity` option which enables network activity logging.
When active, Netty's pipeline is configured for logging on Netty's logger, at `DEBUG` level

This is why switching on the `logActivity` option is not enough.
You also have to set the `io.netty.handler.logging.LoggingHandler` logger to `DEBUG` level in your logging framework configuration.

## When Vert.x is clustered, what happens to event-bus messages if a node crashes?

TODO: explain no persistence

## Why doesn't my event-bus consumer pickup messages sent previously?

TODO: explain no durability
